BEGIN WORK TO DO SECTION BELOW

-------------------------------
-------------------------------
-------------------------------
PLAYER NAME AND WIDGET CLEANUP:

logic for if connects to an ongoing game with an invalid username (DON'T ADD THEM TO THE PLAYER LIST)
cleaning up the "player" list vs server data structure

input name widget - DONE
-------------------------------
NON-CRITICAL FEATURES:


revamping game loop logic to be more robust
Client/Server health check
Make health/full board state check every ~10 seconds. Otherwise PUSH new information from server instead of requesting full board state every x seconds
Make header message dynamic for... either client or server, can't remember. Replace .recv(4000) with message msg_length




Launch server + multiple game instances from a single file for testing purposes



make 'enter' submit playername. Aka bind the submit function to "enter"?

conditional logic so 5th team automatically goes

new character! resistance, revealed to evil at the end of the game (can't be shot as Merlin)
new character! the marauder - if the first three missions are all success or all fail, the opposite team wins (can be assassinated? keeps them from revealing their role?) (Give them the ability to fail missions as good?) (you have to make it so good can't fail missions, otherwise they'll self sabatosh round 3 for the third fail... maybe it doesn't matter because evil would vote it up?.... No. Otherwise this means you NEED an evil on team 3 after two fails. Just houserule if you're good you have to vote succeed.)
new character! normal resistance but with a unique name (claimable)



allow board state to be set during configuration (currently it looks like this doesn't tell the client to update? client log doesn't change from main screen "select roles" to new message) - likely due to the couple second delay hack between starting the client connection and entering your name in the widget - DONE
-------------------------------
VISUALIZATION FEATURES:


removing role information visualization button - Add a tick box which will run the "update_player_lobby_widget_to_start_game" to run with the evil color as "cool blue"

show selected team somehow to other players
yellow boarder around active player (you?)
visualization of hammer?
reveal ALL information visulization function (for end game)
reveal ALL evil for assassination phase?

make "number of fails on a mission" permanently displayed

show player that made team (voting widget)

seperate out the rounds slightly for voting block - DONE (padx and ipadx are .grid configs not label configs)
-------------------------------
GAME FUNCTION CRITICAL:


BUG: Clicking submit and/or approve/fail buttons in rapid succession leads to incorrect team sizes on server









remove command line when avalon.py is ran (simply save as .pyw file.. this worked!!...... maybe compile after this?....) - DONE
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/764631/how-to-hide-console-window-in-python
https://www.google.com/search?q=suppress+command+line+when+running+python+exe&oq=suppress+command+line+when+running+python+exe&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i22i29i30.6591j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

Put server on cloud. See "EXTERNAL SERVER" section - DONE
BUG: Pressing submit will set all backgrounds to "good" color instead of what character knows - FIXED
require multiple fails for round 4!!!/custom rounds - DONE
show team failed with multiple votes - DONE
on team/created team indicator on voter frame - DONE
show players that were on teams (voting widget) - DONE
teams points widget - DONE
-------------------------------
ENG GAME STEP:

assassination phase (don't forget conditional on IF assassin is in the game, assassination phase)
game end phase


saving data structure at the end of the game
adding additional statistics for the end of the game



-------------------------------------
Known bugs:

Server stability
Server game state logic if buttons are clicked too fast

--

Occationally a client disconnecting from server will hang the server. I believe this happens if the server is currently in the middle of a message to the client, the server doesn't process the
DISCONNECT message from the client as it's hanging on "still sending the last board state"


GAME DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK CORRECTLY AFTER DISCONNECT WHEN LAUNCHING FROM THE .EXE!!! Will hang on !INITIAL_CONNECT. Server appears to maintain the connection and not disconnect properly.
Server needs to disconnect from client if client doesn't respond after a period of time?....
Could be several things, client connection might not be closing after closing the application.. could be a bug in the initial connect functions.. could be a bug related to .exe
Looks like it's NOT a problem with the .exe this hangs for python as well. Waiting on a return from !INITIAL_CONNECT but.. it doesn't look like the server receives it?... it doesn't display at least.
[Client Send Function] Sending instructions: ['!INITIAL_CONNECT', '']

Last instruction on the server:

Exception in thread Thread-5:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Nate\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\threading.py", line 917, in _bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File "C:\Users\Nate\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\threading.py", line 865, in run
    self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)
  File "C:\Users\Nate\Documents\GitHub\Avalon-Toolkit\server.py", line 47, in handle_client
    msg_length = conn.recv(HEADER).decode(FORMAT)
ConnectionResetError: [WinError 10054] An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host


PRESSING CTRL + C ON THE TERMINAL FIXED IT!!!!!!
Server must be hanging on multiple connects for some reason


After closing my program it now says:
Exception in thread Thread-8 <---! (thread 8?...)

Upon investigation, this looks normal. Looks like I tried running the application multiple times and even though it was stuck on this one instruction, it somehow still picked up the other connections?

I think the issue might be if you close the client while the server is sending it information it hangs?
Server needs to disconnect from client if client doesn't respond after a period of time?....
Looks like this fixes itself if you ctrl+c from the server's command line, it's hanging on something. It's NOT the .exe doing this, got the same error through avalon.py

---------------------------------------
Known bugs:




Sister displays twice if the user is a sister - sisters are "known" to sisters so they display. Need to add check that says "if this player is me, don't show known roles" - FIXED
Board score is not updating after a mission. But if you close and open the app it does. - FIXED
Users are submitting "fail" for !MISSION but application is showing "'mission_votes_cast': [['Frankie', 'approve'], ['Nate', 'approve']]}, 'Mission 1 passed!']]" - FIXED
-------------------------------
EXTERNAL SERVER:

make server work between external computers!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQasIwElg3w  --set server ip to the cloud service ip, set client ip to a blank string J(which will then update automatically when it's ran?....)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL7fu2R4M8   --might be better, free google cloud service (although you need to enter credit card, it doesn't charge)

make sure executable works
    pyinstaller --onefile pythonScriptName.py  (requires the .png file as well in the same directory for some reason)
    pyinstaller --onefile avalon.pyw

    MANUALLY PUT THE .PNG IN THE "/dist" FOLDER THAT'S CREATED

getting .png into executable?

I think all you need is a folder with avalon.exe and the png in it. Essentially, add the .png to dist and copy/paste the dist folder anywhere, and it should work.





fix server crashes..../locking issues - DONE?....
---------------------------------------
WISHLIST:

Useful resources:

-----

tkinter is just a pythonic wrapper around an embedded tcl interpreter which includes the tk library. The canonical docs for tk mention this feature. 
Here's the reference: tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/grid.htm#M16


Linux:
htop   displays everything running on the server
find the program
"f9"  to kill
press enter

pkill python  




screen python3 server.py  (screen detaches the command from the display window so that you can run your program, and it won't crash if you close the putty display)


tmux command does the same as screen?
