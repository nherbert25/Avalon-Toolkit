BEGIN WORK TO DO SECTION BELOW

-------------------------------
-------------------------------
-------------------------------
PLAYER NAME AND WIDGET CLEANUP:

logic for if connects to an ongoing game with an invalid username (DON'T ADD THEM TO THE PLAYER LIST)
cleaning up the "player" list vs server data structure

input name widget - DONE
-------------------------------
NON-CRITICAL FEATURES:

allow board state to be set during configuration (currently it looks like this doesn't tell the client to update? client log doesn't change from main screen "select roles" to new message)
revamping game loop logic to be more robust

conditional logic so 5th team automatically goes
new character! resistance, revealed to evil at the end of the game (can't be shot as Merlin)
new character! the marauder - if the first three missions are all success or all fail, the opposite team wins (can be assassinated? keeps them from revealing their role?) (Give them the ability to fail missions as good?) (you have to make it so good can't fail missions, otherwise they'll self sabatosh round 3 for the third fail... maybe it doesn't matter because evil would vote it up?.... No. Otherwise this means you NEED an evil on team 3 after two fails. Just houserule if you're good you have to vote succeed.)
new character! normal resistance but with a unique name (claimable)

-------------------------------
VISUALIZATION FEATURES:
removing role information visualization button

show selected team somehow to other players
yellow boarder around active player (you?)
visualization of hammer?
reveal ALL information visulization function (for end game)
reveal ALL evil for assassination phase?

make "number of fails on a mission" permanently displayed

seperate out the rounds slightly for voting block

-------------------------------
GAME FUNCTION CRITICAL:

show player that made team (voting widget)


remove command line when avalon.py is ran (simply save as .pyw file.. this worked!!...... maybe compile after this?....)

BUG: Pressing submit will set all backgrounds to "good" color instead of what character knows
BUG: Clicking submit and/or approve/fail buttons in rapid succession leads to incorrect team sizes on server




require multiple fails for round 4!!!/custom rounds - DONE
show team failed with multiple votes - DONE
on team/created team indicator on voter frame - DONE
show players that were on teams (voting widget) - DONE
teams points widget - DONE
-------------------------------
ENG GAME STEP:

assassination phase (don't forget conditional on IF assassin is in the game, assassination phase)
game end phase


saving data structure at the end of the game
adding additional statistics for the end of the game



-------------------------------------
Known bugs:

Sister displays twice if the user is a sister - sisters are "known" to sisters so they display. Need to add check that says "if this player is me, don't show known roles"




Board score is not updating after a mission. But if you close and open the app it does. - FIXED
Users are submitting "fail" for !MISSION but application is showing "'mission_votes_cast': [['Frankie', 'approve'], ['Nate', 'approve']]}, 'Mission 1 passed!']]" - FIXED


-------------------------------
EXTERNAL SERVER:

make server work between external computers!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQasIwElg3w  --set server ip to the cloud service ip, set client ip to a blank string J(which will then update automatically when it's ran?....)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OL7fu2R4M8   --might be better, free google cloud service (although you need to enter credit card, it doesn't charge)

make sure executable works
    pyinstaller --onefile pythonScriptName.py  (requires the .png file as well in the same directory for some reason)
    pyinstaller --onefile avalon.py

    MANUALLY PUT THE .PNG IN THE "/dist" FOLDER THAT'S CREATED

getting .png into executable?



GAME DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK CORRECTLY AFTER DISCONNECT WHEN LAUNCHING FROM THE .EXE!!! Will hang on !INITIAL_CONNECT and not disconnect properly.
Server needs to disconnect from client if client doesn't respond after a period of time?....





fix server crashes..../locking issues - DONE?....
---------------------------------------
